</div>
    <div id="section2"><div class="centered-text">Combo is a modern hostel chain where art meets a new idea of hospitality. During my time there I was one of the three main repre- sentatives of the marketing department. My duties regarded mainly the production and diffusion of graphic supports used by the four different locations based in Torino, Milano, Venezia, and Bologna.

        <div id="section2"><div class="centered-text"> 
        As part of the marketing department, I helped with the creation and advertising of exhibi- tions, parties, and Dj sets. Talking with artists, musicians, and yoga instructors was only part of my job, I was also in charge of the making of the supports used to promote the events.

</div>
    <div id="section2"><div class="centered-text">The making of an editorial plan and copywrit- ing were the main tasks I followed regarding the brand's social network. Combo is a place where everybody is welcomed, the same can be said for its accounts. We used a friendly and engaging tone of voice putting the spot- light on the beautiful spaces and the enjoyable events that take place every day.

</div>
    <div id="section2"><div class="centered-text">In an always-changing environment like Combo a camera was essential to capture new plates, and friendly faces. I also usually helped during photo shooting where I decorated the different environments.

                <div id="section1"><div class="left-title">Simple and big tasks</div>
</div>
    <div id="section2"><div class="centered-text">Being the only graphic designer I was the sole responsible for the production of simple ele- ments like restaurant menus and merchandis- ing. In the meantime, I kept updating the already existing brand guidelines in order to keep up with the latest trends and innovations. The biggest task I was assigned was the com- plete renovation of the latest location's wayfin- ding, where I worked in collaboration with the external design studio “LeftLoft”.
